## ToDo
 - New High Score should show the ranking if possible
 - High Score Message should differentiate leader-board versus Highest Score (gold star vs trophy and fix the language)
 - Also showing the high scores on the end screen would be fun
 - I skipped the full animation on stage 2 cleared overlay, then I used special clear on stage 3, and the stage cleared overlay did not display stage 2 at all
   - "Current Total" is reduced and does not include stage 2.
 - having a clear right after the misclick can freeze the tweening and leave cells permanently colored
 - the special clear math is wrong in the end
   - stage 1: 163
   - stage 2: 285
   - stage 3: 97
   - stage 4: 118
   - stage 5: 257+3-784 = -524
   - "Current Total: 823 points" when it should be 139 points
   - HUD points behind the overlay shows Points: 0(257-784+3)
